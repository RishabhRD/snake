# Snake

A snake game trying to be reasonable. My main motive of writing this snake game is to test my programming skills.
What I tried to enforce throught the program:

-   Game Logic should not be mixed with viewing game
-   Instead of using MVC design, used Action Model View Architecture
-   Unidirectional data flow
-   Updating state function to be pure
-   Side effects like random fruit generation should be injected
-   Testability of each state of game (bcz side effect is injected)
-   Value semantics
-   No use of pointers
-   No inheritance
-   Polymorphic use with value semantics
